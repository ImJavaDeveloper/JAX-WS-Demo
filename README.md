# JAX-WS-Demo
JAX-WS stands for Java API for XML Web Services. JAX-WS is XML based Java API to build web services server and client application


SOAPPublisher.java
Just run the above program and your web service will be published at the given endpoint in the program. 

We can access itâ€™s WSDL document by adding ?wsdl to the endpoint url as shown in below image.

Hit Below URL To Check Generated WSDL
http://localhost:8888/ws/person?wsdl

Here is the WSDL code, we will use some of the values from these while writing the client code.

SOAPPublisherClient.java
Here is a client program where we are invoking our JAX-WS example web service.

JAX-WS Client Program
If you look at the  program(SOAPPublisherClient), we are using the server code itself . However web services just expose WSDL and third party applications don not have access to these classes. So in that case, we can use wsimport utility to generate the client stubs. This utility comes with standard installation of JDK. Below image shows what all java classes we get when we run this utility.

<pre>
wsimport -s . http://localhost:8888/ws/person?wsdl


C:\Users\Rahat>wsimport -s . http://localhost:8888/ws/person?wsdl
